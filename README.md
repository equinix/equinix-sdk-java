# Equinix Java SDK

This is the official Java SDK for Equinix services.  This SDK is currently provided with a major version of `v0`. We aim to avoid breaking changes to this library, but they will certainly happen as we work towards a stable `v1` library.

Each Equinix service supported by this SDK is maintained as a separate submodule that is generated from the OpenAPI specification for that service.  If any Equinix service is not supported by this SDK and you would like to see it added, please [submit a change request](CONTRIBUTING.md)
